Used 2 approches:

One:
Created a Content type called survey that allows the user to add a survey all in one go, i.e., muultiple questions and their answers at once. The logic will be done the views where values will be extracted from each answer field in relation to the points given and a total is worked out.
Correct answers are also displayed in relation to the points given.
The Fields Conditional Module will be the best bet here.


Two:
Created the survey using the Webform module. This one is simple. I only tested with two questions, however, it is tricky to go the webforms route since the survey is to also cater for non-tech user. Its a bit complex.

Thank you
